2. **Strategic Allocation**: Assigning team members to puzzles based on individual strengths
3. **Parallel Processing**: Working on multiple puzzles simultaneously
4. **Collaborative Verification**: Cross-checking solutions before submission
5. **Adaptive Strategy**: Reallocating resources as puzzles were solved or roadblocks encountered
