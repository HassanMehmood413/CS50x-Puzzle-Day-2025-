## Problem-Solving Approach

Our team approached the CS50 Puzzle Day with a structured methodology:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Quick evaluation of all puzzles to categorize by type and difficulty
2. **Strategic Allocation**: Assigning team members to puzzles based on individual strengths
3. **Parallel Processing**: Working on multiple puzzles simultaneously
4. **Collaborative Verification**: Cross-checking solutions before submission
5. **Adaptive Strategy**: Reallocating resources as puzzles were solved or roadblocks encountered

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python for algorithm implementation
- Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis
- Collaborative whiteboarding tools
- Custom-built cipher decoder
- Graph visualization software

## Lessons Learned

- The importance of diverse problem-solving approaches
- Effective time management under pressure
- Communication techniques for complex problem description
- The power of combining different areas of expertise
